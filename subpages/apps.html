      <div class="description">
        Bitcoin blocks are meant to be found, on average, every ten minutes. The hashpower of the network (and other variables) are constantly changing, meaning that this is often not the case. This app will attempt to predict when the next block will be found based on previous block times, as well as provide some other useful information.
